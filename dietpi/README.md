# ⚡️ RaspiBlitz on DietPi ⚡️
#  A hardware agnostic platform

First tested on an Odroid HC1. It has no connection for an LCD, but the [hardware specs](hw_comparison.md) make up for it.

## Setting up the DietPi OS

### Download the updated DietPi image

For the Odroid HC1 / HC2 / XU3 / XU4 a v6.20.6 DietPi image with fail2ban installed is uploaded here:  
https://mega.nz/#!AcdVBAbR!O-W3jP5LUgw7lMY8S9XcBWcKX3IhRNAAFmaYzDXIUC0  

Burn the SDCard with [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) and extend the rootfs partition to the size of your card with a partition manager.

Insert the SDcard into the Odroid.

Power up and continue with: [Run the DietPi optimized Raspiblitz SDcard build script](#Run-the-DietPi-optimized-Raspiblitz-SDcard-build-script)

### Build your own DietPi image:

For the Odroid HC1 / HC2 / XU3 / XU4 download this image:   
https://dietpi.com/downloads/images/DietPi_OdroidXU4-ARMv7-Stretch.7z  
and burn it to the SD with [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/)

Getting started with DietPi: https://dietpi.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=9#p9  

In the desktop terminal on Linux / MacOS or Putty on Windows:  

`ssh root@[IP-OF-DIETPI]`  
password: `dietpi`  

Ok > Cancel > Cancel  
automatic apt update & apt upgrade and asks to reboot
![](pictures/dietpi_1st_reboot.png)  

`ssh root@[IP-OF-DIETPI]`  
after the previous update the ssh keys might change:

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@  
@ WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED! @  
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@  

run (can be copied from the terminal output):   
`ssh-keygen -f "/home/[your-linux-username]/.ssh/known_hosts" -R "dietpi.IP"`

`ssh root@[IP-OF-DIETPI]`   
yes >   
password: `dietpi`  

At this point if the DietPi was not updated from 6.14 it does not manage to save settings going forward.  
Exit the sotware installer (press Tab to jump to Exit)
![](pictures/dietpi-software_exit.png)  

in the bash prompt run:  
`dietpi-update`
>Ok > Cancel the recovery point   
update > >Opt out of survey > Ok  
Reboots

`ssh root@[IP-OF-DIETPI]`  
password: `dietpi` 

>Ok > Cancel > Cancel  
Search `fail2ban` > Space to select > Enter   
> Install > Ok  
>Opt out of survey > Ok  
Reboots again

## Run the DietPi optimized Raspiblitz SDcard build script

In the desktop terminal in Linux / MacOS or Putty in Windows:

`ssh root@[IP-OF-DIETPI]`  
password: `dietpi` 
Should end up here on version v6.20.6 or higher: 
![](pictures/bash_prompt.png)

run the SDcard build script in this format:
`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/[GITHUB-USERNAME]/raspiblitz/[BRANCH]/build.sdcard/raspbianStretchDesktop.sh && sudo bash raspbianStretchDesktop.sh [BRANCH] [GITHUB-USERNAME]`

Be aware of that the fork needs to be called `raspiblitz` for the git download to work.
if you intend to use @openoms`s forked version:

`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openoms/raspiblitz/raspiblitz-dev/build.sdcard/raspbianStretchDesktop.sh && sudo bash raspbianStretchDesktop.sh raspiblitz-dev openoms`

See my example output on the Odorid HC1: [HC1_sdcard_build_output](logs/HC1_sdcard_build_output)  

`ssh admin@[IP-OF-DROIDBLITZ]`  
password: raspiblitz

### The setup continues as described in the RaspiBlitz setup [README.md](/README.md#documentation)



### Examples of copying the blockchain data from a HDD using a powered USB to SATA adapter

### Useful commands for debugging:
To test a new configuration run XXcleanHDD.sh and strictly restart
(this makes _bootstrap.sh and 00mainMenu.sh run in the right order)

`tail -n1000 -f /var/tmp/dietpi/logs/dietpi-automation_custom_script.log` follow startup setup script log  
`lsblk` see the partitions  
`tail -n1000 -f raspiblitz.log` - debug logs of bootstrap.sh  
`sudo tail -f /mnt/hdd/bitcoin/debug.log` - continuous monitoring  
`sudo tail -n100 /mnt/hdd/bitcoin/debug.log` - shows the last 100 lines  
`sudo systemctl status lnd`  
`sudo journalctl -f -u lnd`  
`./home/admin/XXdebugLogs.sh` - debug log collection on the raspiblitz 

Currently the DietPi update process has a bug causing bootloop if left alone. Will be sorted once the current, >6.2 version is uploaded as the starting image.
Here find some excerpts from the deafult dietpi.txt (https://github.com/Fourdee/DietPi/blob/master/dietpi.txt) to be used once the automatic install is feasible:

### Automate installation with the dietpi.txt
Need to copy to SDcard /boot/dietpi.txt after burning the image with Etcher.
IMPORTANT:
- Modifications to /boot/dietpi.txt will not be preserved on reboot.
- Please ensure you edit from the DietPi-RAMdisk location: /DietPi/dietpi.txt
NB: This is intended for advanced users, unless you know what you are doing, do not edit this file. ease use the DietPi programs instead.
NB: Do not remove uncommented lines, as the items are scraped by DietPi programs, on demand.
DietPi-Automation settings, applied on the 1st boot of DietPi, ONCE
Sample:
https://github.com/Fourdee/DietPi/blob/master/dietpi.txt

### DietPi-Software to automatically install.  
Requires `AUTO_SETUP_AUTOMATED=1  `
For a list of software index's (ID's), run '/DietPi/dietpi/dietpi-software list'  
No limit on number entries, add as many as you need and uncomment the line.  
DietPi will automatically install all pre-reqs (eg: ALSA/XSERVER for desktops etc)  
>install fail2ban  
AUTO_SETUP_INSTALL_SOFTWARE_ID=73  
install OpenSSH Client  
AUTO_SETUP_INSTALL_SOFTWARE_ID=0  
install OpenSSH Server  
AUTO_SETUP_INSTALL_SOFTWARE_ID=105  


### Custom Script (post-networking and post-DietPi install) 
Runs after DietPi installation is completed
Allows you to automatically execute a custom script at the end of DietPi installation.  
Option 1 = Copy your script to /boot/Automation_Custom_Script.sh and it will be executed automatically.  
Option 2 = Host your script online, then use AUTO_SETUP_CUSTOM_SCRIPT_EXEC=http://myweb.com/myscript.sh, it will be downloaded and executed automatically. | 0=disabled  
NB: Executed script log /var/tmp/dietpi/logs/dietpi-automation_custom_script.log
