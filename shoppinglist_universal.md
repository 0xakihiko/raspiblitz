# Shopping List: Universal, you will be directed to your country store. 

*__NOTICE: This shopping list still needs testing of listed components__ - [please report](https://github.com/rootzoll/raspiblitz/issues/691) if you have bad experiences or ideas for better cheaper updates.*

The new shopping list comes in three different packages: Minimal, Standard & Maximal:

## Package: Standard (around 250 USD)

*The "Standard Package" is most tested and recommended if you can effort it. It aims to give you the best economic value to run all the RaspiBlitz features at a good performance and even allows you to self-validate your blockchain in under 3 days.* 

* RaspBerry Pi 4 2GB + Power: [amazon](https://geni.us/raspiblitz-2gb-power)
* ShimFan Cooling: [amazon](https://geni.us/raspiblitz-fanshim)
* 500GB SSD: [amazon](https://geni.us/raspiblitz-500gb-ssd)
* SSD-Case: [amazon](https://geni.us/raspiblitz-ssd-case) 
* Micro SD-Card 32GB: [amazon](https://geni.us/raspiblitz-sc-card)
* LCD-Display: [amazon](https://geni.us/raspiblitz-touchscreen) 
* RaspberryPi-Case: [amazon](https://geni.us/raspiblitz-case) 

## Package: Minimal (around 180 USD)

*The minimal package aims for the cheapest price and allows you to use old hardware. It will always be possible to run all the basic features of a Bitcoin- & Lightning-Fullnode, but the system might be too slow to validate the blockchain history by itself and run some resource intensive extended services.*

Basic Parts for all minimal variants:
* 1TB Hard Drive: [amazon](https://geni.us/raspiblitz-hdd)
* Micro SD-Card 16GB: [amazon](https://geni.us/raspiblitz-sd-card16gb)
* LCD-Display: [amazon](https://geni.us/raspiblitz-touchscreen) 

If you have already a used RaspberryPi 3 B+ you can reuse with the following parts:
* RaspBerry Pi 3: [amazon](https://geni.us/raspiblitz-rpi3)
* Power >=3A: [amazon](https://geni.us/raspiblitz-3A-power)
* Heatsink-Case: [amazon](https://geni.us/raspiblitz-heatsink)

* ShimFan Cooling: [amazon](https://geni.us/raspiblitz-fanshim)
* RaspberryPi-Case: [amazon](https://geni.us/raspiblitz-case) 

## Package: Maximal

*The maximal package is still in the works ... if you want to prepare for it, take the standard package as a base and choose the RaspberryPi4 with 4GB and a high quality 1TB SSD instead of 500GB.*
