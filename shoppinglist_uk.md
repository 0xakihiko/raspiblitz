# Shopping List: UK

*__NOTICE: This shopping list had just basic testing of components__ - [please report](https://github.com/rootzoll/raspiblitz/issues/691) if you have bad experiences or ideas for better cheaper updates.*

The new shopping list comes in three different packages: Minimal, Standard & Maximal:

## Package: Standard (around 200 EUR)

*The "Standard Package" is most tested and recommended if you can effort it. It aims to give you the best economic value to run all the RaspiBlitz features at a good performance and even allows you to self-validate your blockchain in under 3 days.* 

* RaspBerry Pi 4 2GB: [pimoroni.com](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/raspberry-pi-4?variant=29157087412307)
* ShimFan Cooling: [pimoroni.com](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/fan-shim) (order later if sold out)
* Power USBC: [pimoroni.com](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/universal-usb-c-power-supply-5-1v-3a)
* RaspberryPi-Case: [pimoroni.com](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pibow-coupe-4?variant=29210100105299)
* 500GB SSD: [amazon.co.uk](https://amzn.to/384kwaG)
* SSD-Case: [amazon.co.uk](https://amzn.to/2SkOLU9)
* Micro SD-Card 32GB: [amazon.co.uk](https://amzn.to/31sBop4)
* LCD-Display: [amazon.co.uk](https://amzn.to/2S0oOtU)

## Package: Minimal (around 150 EUR)

*The minimal package aims for the cheapest price and allows you to use old hardware. It will always be possible to run all the basic features of a Bitcoin- & Lightning-Fullnode, but the system might be too slow to validate the blockchain history by itself and run some resource intensive extended services.*

Basic Parts for all minimal variants:
* 1TB Hard Drive: [amazon.co.uk](https://amzn.to/3bpZaXo)
* Micro SD-Card 16GB: [amazon.co.uk](https://amzn.to/2OyIKlH)
* LCD-Display: [amazon.co.uk](https://amzn.to/2SlQp7Y)

* Power >=3A: [amazon.co.uk](https://amzn.to/2Oy4VbE)

## Package: Maximal

*The maximal package is still in the works ... if you want to prepare for it, take the standard package as a base and choose the RaspberryPi4 with 4GB and a high quality 1TB SSD instead of 500GB.*

* 500GB SSD: [amazon.co.uk](https://amzn.to/3bcI7I6)
