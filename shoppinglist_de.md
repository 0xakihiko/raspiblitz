## Shopping List: Germany

The new shopping list comes in three different packages: Minimal, Standard & Maximal:

### Standard Shopping list (under 200 EUR)

*The "Standard Package" is most tested and recommended if you can effort it. It aims to give you the best economic value to run all the RaspiBlitz features at a good performance and even allows you to self-validate your blockchain in under 3 days.* 

* RaspBerry Pi 4 2GB: https://shop.pimoroni.de/products/raspberry-pi-4?variant=29212362801254

* RaspberryPi-Case: https://shop.pimoroni.de/products/pibow-coupe-4?variant=29212366405734

## Package: Minimal (under 150 EUR)

*The minimal package aims for the cheapest price and allows you to use old hardware. It will always be possible to run all the basic features of a Bitcoin- & Lightning-Fullnode, but the system might be too slow to validate the blockchain history by itself and run some resource intensive extended services.*

Basic Parts for all minimal variants:
* 1TB Hard Drive: https://www.amazon.de/dp/B07997KKSK?th=1
* Micro SD-Card 32GB: https://www.amazon.de/dp/B073JWXGNT
