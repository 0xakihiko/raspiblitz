*The listed Power Supply showed on testing sometimes some udervoltages - if you find a better Power Supply (like on the german shopping list) on the italian Amazon, please send a PullRequest to improve this shoppingl list. Thx.*

**OPTIONAL**: To reduce the risk of undervoltage causing data corruption on the HDD its recommended to add a **Powered USB 3 Hub between HDD and Raspberry Pi** as an additional power source between Raspberry Pi and the HDD. Any Powered USB 3 Hub should work.
